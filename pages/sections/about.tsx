          Our Mission
        </h3>
        <p>
          Our mission is to cultivate the next generation of BioHackers and healthcare advocates 
          and help meet the patient care needs of today with the technology of tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a beginner-friendly and multidisciplinary hackathon, BioHack aims to give students 
          the opportunity to create innovative and personalized solutions and save lives with 
          their projects. During BioHack, students will get the opportunity to form teams and 
          collaborate, attend workshops to learn about new technologies, and network with 
          industry partners.
        </p>
        <p>
          BioHack invites students with a passion to help the community to work together to move 
          healthcare forward and cultivate the biotechnology hub of the Inland Empire.
